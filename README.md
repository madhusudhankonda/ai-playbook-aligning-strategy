### **Step 4: Initiative Definition**
For each AI initiative, define:
- Business problem and AI solution approach
- Owner, timeline, complexity, and expected impact
- 3-phase implementation plan (Pilot → MVP → Scale)
- Success metrics and KPIs

### **Step 5: Impact Estimation**

- **Investment Required**: Technology, personnel, infrastructure costs
- **Operational Impact**: Efficiency gains, quality improvements
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical, business, and timeline risks

### **Step 6: Portfolio Matrix**
Visualize initiatives in a 2x2 matrix:
- **Quick Wins**: Low complexity, high impact (highest priority)
- **Strategic Bets**: High complexity, high impact (second priority)
- **Fill-ins**: Low complexity, low impact
- **Question Marks**: High complexity, low impact (review needed)

### **Step 7: Stakeholder Alignment**

- Quarterly action items with specific next steps
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Exportable report for stakeholder communication

## 💡 Best Practices

### **1. Start Business-First**
Always begin with business problems, not AI capabilities. Ask "What business challenge are we solving?" before "What AI technology should we use?"

### **2. Be Realistic About Capabilities**
Honestly assess your organization's readiness. Low scores indicate foundation-building is needed before complex AI initiatives.

### **3. Prioritize Quick Wins**
Focus first on low-complexity, high-impact initiatives to build momentum and demonstrate value.

### **4. Manage Stakeholders Early**
Involve key stakeholders in the process from the beginning. AI changes decision-making, which affects power and culture.

### **5. Measure Everything**
Every initiative should have clear, measurable success criteria. Track both leading indicators (progress) and lagging indicators (outcomes).
